    "This one was interesting. It feels a bit duct taped together, and I probably need to review CSS and HTML, but building on a previous follow along project, I was able to get it to work. The scheduler could execute this script on startup amd check if it can download a page for a URL ending in today's date. I had to handle the redirect a little funny given _raise_for_status()_ did not raise an error for redirects."
